<h1>How <u>Video game's</u> are created</h1>

<h3>What is a <u>video game?</u></h3>
<p>A video game or computer game is an electronic game that involves interaction with a user interface or input device (such as a joystick, controller, keyboard, or motion sensing device) to generate visual feedback from a display device, most commonly shown in a video format on a television set, computer monitor, flat-panel display or touchscreen on handheld devices, or a virtual reality headset. Most modern video games are audiovisual, with audio complement delivered through speakers or headphones, and sometimes also with other types of sensory feedback (e.g., haptic technology that provides tactile sensations), and some video games also allow microphone and webcam inputs for in-game chatting and livestreaming.People still love to play video games mostly kid's</p>
<p>Video games are typically categorized according to their hardware platform, which traditionally includes arcade video games, console games, and computer (PC) games; the latter also encompasses LAN games, online games, and browser games. More recently, the video game industry has expanded onto mobile gaming through mobile devices (such as smartphones and tablet computers), virtual and augmented reality systems, and remote cloud gaming. Video games are also classified into a wide range of genres based on their style of gameplay and target audience.</p>
<h3>How do they work?</h3>
<p>All electronic games begin as computer instructions called software. A computer programmer writes the software commands to make the game run. The game software is then loaded onto hardware—a computer or a console.</p>

<p>Inside the computer or the console, hardware and software work together to send electronic signals through the system. These signals create the game’s sounds and images. The player controls the action of the game using a paddle, a joystick, or a keypad.</p>
<h3>How many games were devloped</h3>
<p>Mobile game downloads may have had some stagnation in recent years, but even so, they are still pulling massive numbers year after year. This can partially be linked to the growing popularity and capability of smartphones. To find out more, here are some key trends:</p>
<ul>
<li>There were 55.6 billion mobile game downloads in 2022.

<li>This marks a 0.5% increase from 2021 when there were approximately 55.3 billion mobile game downloads.
</ul>
The number of annual mobile game downloads increased by 129% between 2015 and 2022.</p>
<h3>Does games takes time?</h3>
<p>Yes,Games take longer to make. That's what Head of Xbox Game Studios Matt Booty told Axios in an interview on Monday. In his interview with the outlet, Booty said that fans need to understand that games just don't get made at the same speed they used to and there was a game called Duke Nukem Forever Unsurprisingly, the award for most delayed game of all time goes to Duke Nukem Forever, the sequel to 1996's Duke Nukem 3D that took a whopping 15 years to see through to completion.</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<br>
<p>The history of video games began in the 1950s and 1960s as computer scientists began designing simple games and simulations on minicomputers and mainframes. Spacewar! was developed by Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) student hobbyists in 1962 as one of the first such games on a video display. The first consumer video game hardware was released in the early 1970s. The first home video game console was the Magnavox Odyssey, and the first arcade video games were Computer Space and Pong. After its home console conversions, numerous companies sprang up to capture Pong's success in both the arcade and the home by cloning the game, causing a series of boom and bust cycles due to oversaturation and lack of innovation.<p>

<p>By the mid-1970s, low-cost programmable microprocessors replaced the discrete transistor–transistor logic circuitry of early hardware, and the first ROM cartridge-based home consoles arrived, including the Atari Video Computer System (VCS). Coupled with rapid growth in the golden age of arcade video games, including Space Invaders and Pac-Man, the home console market also flourished. The 1983 video game crash in the United States was characterized by a flood of too many games, often of poor or cloned qualities, and the sector saw competition from inexpensive personal computers and new types of games being developed for them. The crash prompted Japan's video game industry to take leadership of the market, which had only suffered minor impacts from the crash. Nintendo released its Nintendo Entertainment System in the United States in 1985, helping to rebound the failing video games sector. The latter part of the 1980s and early 1990s included video games driven by improvements and standardization in personal computers and the console war competition between Nintendo and Sega as they fought for market share in the United States. The first major handheld video game consoles appeared in the 1990s, led by Nintendo's Game Boy platform.</p>

<p>In the early 1990s, advancements in microprocessor technology gave rise to real-time 3D polygonal graphic rendering in game consoles, as well as in PCs by way of graphics cards. Optical media via CD-ROMs began to be incorporated into personal computers and consoles, including Sony's fledgling PlayStation console line, pushing Sega out of the console hardware market while diminishing Nintendo's role. By the late 1990s, the Internet also gained widespread consumer use, and video games began incorporating online elements. Microsoft entered the console hardware market in the early 2000s with its Xbox line, fearing that Sony's PlayStation positioned as a game console and entertainment device, would displace personal computers. While Sony and Microsoft continued to develop hardware for comparable top-end console features, Nintendo opted to focus on innovative gameplay. Nintendo developed the Wii with motion-sensing controls, which helped to draw in non-traditional players and helped to resecure Nintendo's position in the industry; Nintendo followed this same model in the release of the Nintendo Switch.</p>
